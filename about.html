          <p>Hi, I'm Jackie and I'm SO glad that you're here! :
            I love nothing more in this world than love & capturing it in all it's different forms. I am here to serve YOU and to help tell YOUR story just the way it is through photographs (just look at me as your modern day historian with a camera). I love being able capture the raw moments in life-celebrating the big moments, the small moments, and everything in between. When you book a session with me, you can expect our session to go a little like this: we'll meet up & chat for a bit, we'll take a couple of posed shots, and then I'll make you do all sorts of weird things like spinning around, running wild, rolling around on the ground, making random noises, etc :) Why? Because it's fun and you'll be dying laughing and I will capture photos of you in the moment as you are--living your BEST life. I aim to capture moments that make you FEEL.</p>
